# BigDataCreditCardFraudDetection

Course Project for CS6502 - Applied Big Data and Visualization

Title - Big Data Approach for Credit Card Fraud Detection

Group 11 Submission

Technologies Utilised:
- PySpark
- Google Colab Notebooks
- Microsoft Power BI

.ipynb Notebook Contains:

Python Code for performing Data Loading (ETL Pipeline), Data Summarizing (Plots, Data Summary, Categorical and Numerical Features, Imbalance in Dataset), Data Cleaning (Removing Null Values), Data Transformation (Adding 3 new Features), Data Preparation (Undersampling, Indexing, Hot Encoding, Scaling), Model Training (Logistic Regression, Random Forests, Perceptron), and Model Evaluation Metrics including why Perceptron is Preferred. 

Key Takeaways:
 - The incorporation of large-scale data analytics and machine learning tools increased the efficiency of detection and monitoring through our project. 
 - Undersampling performs well for model training. 
 - The Perceptron classifier gives a marginally higher recall value. Hence utilizing it is beneficial for reducing False Negatives. 
 - Visualisations aid in making data-driven decisions and visualising the dataset. 
 - Continuous vigilance and adaptation are essential in combating evolving fraud tactics.
